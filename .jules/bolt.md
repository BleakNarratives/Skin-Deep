## 2025-05-18 - Scroll Handler Layout Thrashing & Unmemoized Chart Components
**Learning:** High-frequency scroll event listeners reading DOM element geometry (`offsetTop`, `offsetHeight`) cause layout thrashing and high main-thread CPU usage on every scroll pixel. Unmemoized Recharts components re-render heavy SVG trees whenever active section state updates.
**Action:** Throttle scroll listeners with `requestAnimationFrame` and `{ passive: true }`, and wrap SVG chart components in `React.memo` to skip redundant re-renders.

## 2025-05-19 - Unmemoized PRNG Path Generation in Interactive SVG Components
**Learning:** In interactive SVG stencil tools, slider inputs (like scale and opacity controls) trigger continuous re-renders. If geometric path algorithms using PRNG loops and trigonometric math (`Math.sin`, `Math.cos`) are not wrapped in `useMemo`, every drag tick recalculates complex path strings, causing frame drops during UI interactions.
**Action:** Wrap procedural path generation functions in `useMemo` dependent only on design seed/style parameters, and wrap interactive SVG sub-components in `React.memo`.

## 2025-05-20 - Unstable Callback Dependencies Invalidating Memoized Child Navigation
**Learning:** Passing unstable callback functions to memoized navigation components (`Sidebar` wrapped in `React.memo`) causes full component tree re-renders whenever state objects change. Additionally, triggering state updates (`setActiveSection`) that already run side-effects in `useEffect` creates duplicate API calls.
**Action:** Memoize API handlers with `useCallback` and keep section navigation callbacks clean with empty dependency arrays `[]` so memoized children skip re-renders.

## 2025-05-21 - N+1 Query Pattern in Nested Entity Tree Retrieval
**Learning:** Constructing nested hierarchical data trees (e.g. `episode_tree` querying episodes -> scenes -> panels) by looping over child IDs and executing individual SQL queries per child causes N+1 query proliferation and repetitive SQLite connection open/close overhead under web server requests.
**Action:** Use a single `JOIN` query inside a shared read transaction to fetch all child entities in batch, mapping them to parent entities via an in-memory dictionary lookup to reduce database connection and query complexity from O(N) to O(1).
